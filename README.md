# EVOS-Image-Processing
This Code uses Cellpose (and Fiji) to batch-analyze data from single-channel TIFs of a 3-color image corresponding to different wells of a 96-well plate scanned at 10X magnification in an EVOS M7000 microscope from ThermoFisher.
There are 7 steps that use Python, and one that uses FIJI. 
The Python files and the FIJI macro I used are all present. The FIJI macro is utilized between steps 3.2 and 4. 
Eventually, I will learn how to integrate FIJI into Python and this will work a bit better but as of now, this is fine. 
There is an example of this code running in my Jupyter Notebook as well as the individual scripts. 
If you have questions or improvements, I would love to hear from you! I'm a beginner in coding for image analysis and am always looking to improve
